## Database Design
This section outlines the core entities and their relationships within the AirBnB Clone project. The design ensures efficient data management for properties, bookings, users, and transactions.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Users
Represents individuals who can list properties, book accommodations, and leave reviews.

Important Fields:

id (Primary Key)

name

email

password_hash

user_type (e.g., host or guest)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Properties
Represents the accommodation listings available for booking.

Important Fields:

id (Primary Key)

title

description

price_per_night

owner_id (Foreign Key referencing Users)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Bookings
Records reservations made by users for specific properties.

Important Fields:

id (Primary Key)

user_id (Foreign Key referencing Users)

property_id (Foreign Key referencing Properties)

start_date

end_date

4Ô∏è‚É£ Reviews
Captures feedback from users regarding their stay at a property.

Important Fields:

id (Primary Key)

user_id (Foreign Key referencing Users)

property_id (Foreign Key referencing Properties)

rating

comment

5Ô∏è‚É£ Payments
Tracks financial transactions for bookings.

Important Fields:

id (Primary Key)

booking_id (Foreign Key referencing Bookings)

amount

payment_date

payment_method

üìé Entity Relationships
A User can list multiple Properties (one-to-many)

A Property can receive multiple Bookings (one-to-many)

A Booking belongs to one User and one Property (many-to-one)

A Booking can have one Payment (one-to-one)

A User can leave multiple Reviews, and each Review is for one Property (many-to-one)

A Property can have multiple Reviews (one-to-many)

## Feature Breakdown
1Ô∏è‚É£ User Management
Allows users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles. This ensures that both hosts and guests have secure, personalized access to the platform.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Property Management
Enables hosts to add, update, and delete property listings. Each property can include details like descriptions, prices, and images for potential guests to view.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Booking System
Allows users to book available properties for specific dates. This feature manages booking requests, availability, and reservation confirmations.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Review System
Lets users leave feedback about their stays and view reviews from others. This helps build trust and improves the platform's credibility.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Payment Processing
Handles secure transactions for property bookings. It ensures that payments are recorded, tracked, and associated with the correct bookings.

## API Security
To protect user data and maintain system integrity, the AirBnB Clone project will implement key security measures:

Authentication: Verifies user identity through secure methods like JWT, ensuring only authorized users can access the system.

Authorization: Controls user permissions based on roles (guest, host), preventing unauthorized actions on resources.

Rate Limiting: Restricts the number of API requests per user to prevent abuse and server overload.

Data Validation: Ensures all input data is clean and secure, protecting against injection attacks.

Secure Payments: Handles transactions through encrypted channels, safeguarding sensitive financial data.

These measures are crucial to protect user accounts, personal information, and payments while keeping the platform reliable and secure.

## CI/CD Pipeline
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are development practices that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. CI/CD pipelines help detect errors early, speed up development, and ensure the application remains reliable as new features are added.

For this project, a CI/CD pipeline will automatically run tests, build the application, and deploy updates to the production environment. This reduces manual work and ensures consistent, error-free deployments.

Tools that could be used include:

GitHub Actions: Automates workflows like testing and deployment directly from the repository.

Docker: Packages the application into containers for consistent deployment across environments.

Heroku / Render / Vercel: Can be used for hosting and automatic deployments.
